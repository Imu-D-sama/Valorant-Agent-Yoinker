# Valorant-Agent-Yoinker

A tool that makes you instalock any agent you want and dodge the game

**!!!This tool was originally made by https://github.com/deadly and then updated by me to include every agent and the ability to dodge a game and save your region!!!**

you can contact me at my discord .imu_sama.

# how to use

1. First you have to download the compiled version and run it(**MAKE SURE THE GAME IS RUNNING WHILE USING IT**) or just download and run main.py.
2. it will ask for the region (first lunch only) which will be one from the following (EU, NA, AP, BR, LATAM, KR).
3. then it will ask you for your preferred agent(Reyna, Brim, etc.....).
4. then you start a game and the tool will tell you when the agent is locked(usually during the countdown)
5. have fun :)
